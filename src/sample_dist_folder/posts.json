I'm Emma, a mixed media artist based in Portland, creating works that blur the boundaries between painting, collage, and textile art. My pieces explore themes of memory, identity, and the natural world through vibrant colors and unexpected textures.\n\nI believe art should invite curiosity and create conversation. Each piece I create tells a story—sometimes mine, sometimes yours, and often somewhere in between.\n\nFeatured Works\n\n\"Fragments of Autumn\"\n\nMixed media on canvas, 36\" × 48\"\n\nA meditation on change and renewal, incorporating pressed leaves, handmade paper, and layers of translucent acrylics that shift with the light.\n\n\"Urban Whispers\"\n\nTextile assemblage with oil pastel, 24\" × 30\"\n\nInspired by city landscapes at dusk, this piece weaves together found fabric, photographs, and hand-stitched elements to create a tactile urban landscape.\n\n\"Echoes of Home\"\n\nCollage with watercolor and ink, 18\" × 24\"\n\nAn exploration of belonging, featuring fragments of old letters, maps, and botanical drawings layered with delicate washes of color.\n\nView Full Gallery →\n\nUpcoming Events\n\nSolo Exhibition: \"Between Worlds\" at Riverside Gallery\nMay 15 - June 30, 2025\n\nArtist Talk: Creative Process Workshop at Portland Art Center\nJune 12, 2025 | 2:00 PM\n\nArt Fair: Pacific Northwest Arts Festival\nJuly 8-10, 2025 | Booth #42\n\nSee All Events →\n\nRecent Recognition\n\n\"Emma Reyes creates layered worlds that invite viewers to look closer, then closer still—revealing intimate stories within stories.\"\n\n— Northwest Arts Magazine, March 2025\n\n\"Her innovative use of materials transforms everyday objects into meaningful narratives that resonate with authentic emotion.\"\n\n— Contemporary Art Review, January 2025\n\nStudio Process\n\nMy practice is deeply rooted in experimentation and intuition.

    "plain": "About Emma Reyes\n\nArtist, Educator, Explorer\n\nMy Artistic Journey\n\nBorn and raised in the Pacific Northwest, I've always been drawn to the intersection of natural beauty and human creativity. My journey as an artist began with traditional painting, but quickly evolved to incorporate a diverse range of materials and techniques.\n\nAfter earning my MFA from the Pacific Northwest College of Art in 2015, I established my studio practice in Portland, where the vibrant art community and proximity to nature continue to inspire my work.\n\nArtistic Approach\n\nMy work exists at the crossroads of several disciplines:\n\nMixed Media Painting - Combining traditional painting techniques with collage and assemblage\n\nTextile Integration - Incorporating hand-stitched elements and fabric remnants\n\nNatural Elements - Using found objects from nature to create texture and meaning\n\nSustainable Practices - Emphasizing repurposed materials and environmental consciousness\n\nI believe that art should be accessible without sacrificing depth. My pieces invite viewers to approach them on multiple levels—appreciating initial beauty while discovering layers of meaning with continued engagement.\n\nEducation & Training\n\nMFA in Contemporary Art Practice - Pacific Northwest College of Art, 2015\n\nBA in Fine Arts - University of Washington, 2011\n\nArtist Residency - Sitka Center for Art and Ecology, 2018\n\nMaster Workshop - Mixed Media Techniques with Claire Thompson, 2019\n\nTeaching & Community\n\nAlongside my studio practice, I'm passionate about arts education. I regularly lead workshops for adults and youth at the Portland Art Center, focusing on experimental techniques and creative exploration.\n\nI believe strongly in art as a tool for community building and social change. Through my involvement with the Arts for All initiative, I help bring creative opportunities to underserved neighborhoods throughout Portland.\n\nPersonal Influences\n\nMy work is deeply influenced by:\n\nThe textural complexity of the Pacific Northwest landscape\n\nJapanese aesthetic principles, particularly wabi-sabi\n\nThe feminist art movement of the 1970s\n\nContemporary collage artists like Wangechi Mutu and Mark Bradford\n\nThe poetry of Mary Oliver and her attention to natural detail\n\nWhen not in the studio, you'll find me hiking with my dog Luna, foraging for natural materials, or exploring small galleries and museums across the region.",
