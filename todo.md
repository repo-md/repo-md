we were deploying to github pages, but now that we use a
custom domain, it's not working anymore, we get the
index_legacy.html showing if we acceess it on the doamin, but
the demo, that we used to build isn't available... why? Demo
was mapped to repo-md, to match repo name on gh pages. now our
domain is mapped to root of deployment. help fix it. firgure
out why
